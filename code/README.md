REST API Development with Flask and Flask-RESTful
---

The bare server we will start with is `server.py` and the final reference implementation is `reference_server.py`.

First, make sure you have Python 3.X, then install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Now, to run the server, type `python server.py` in your terminal and then go to your browser at `127.0.0.1:5000`. 

NOTE: You might need to have CORS disabled or a CORS plugin enabled (For example, on Chrome you can use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog).
